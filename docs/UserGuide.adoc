== Introduction

Debt Tracker (DT) is for those *who prefer to use a desktop app for tracking the user’s loans.*
DT has a mixed usage of *Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI).*
For more basic commands, one may use CLI, but DT has also simplified potentially longer commands through the use of GUI.
DT can keep a record of your loans and debts as fast as other apps, if not faster!
