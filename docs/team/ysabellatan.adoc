== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to *keep a separate list for paid transactions*
** What it does: Allows the user to keep track of transactions that have been paid off
** Justification: This feature helps the user keep a history of transactions that have been settled, which they can use
in case the other party involved in the transaction tries to confuse the user's memory, or to dispute whether a
transaction has been paid. This protects the user from possibly being scammed into making the same payment again. +
Furthermore, it helps them keep track of how their current financial status came to be what it is, based on the past
transactions they made and keep track of in the paid transactions list.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an deep understanding of AddressBook-Level4's original code in order to be
implemented, as in order to add this enhancement, I had to refactor several functions and classes and use the data
structures they implemented.

 were only for the current transaction list, available for the paid transactions list]]

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the wildcard search feature*
** What it does: allows the user to locate a transaction linked to a person whose first or last name contains the
substring
** Justification: Sometimes the user may not be entirely sure of how a name is spelt, or they may forget how to spell
their transaction partner's full name. With this feature, they need not remember the full name in order to find the
intended transaction.
